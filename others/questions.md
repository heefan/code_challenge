### Question 1
	Joel and Henry are playing a game. They have N balls numbered from 0 to N−1. 	Henry asks Joel to reverse the position of the balls, i.e., to change the order from say, 0,1,2,3 to 3,2,1,0. He further asks Joel to reverse the position of the balls N times, each time starting from one position further to the right, till he reaches the last ball. So, Joel has to reverse the positions of the ball starting from 0th position, then from 1st position, then from 2nd position and so on. At the end of the game, Henry will ask Joel the final position of any ball numbered K. Joel will win the game, if he can answer. Help Joel
	Input	The first line contains an integer T, i.e., the number of the test cases.	The next T lines will contain two integers N and K.
	Output	Print the final index in array.
	
	Constraints: 
	1 ≤ T ≤ 50
	1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
	0 ≤ K < N

	Explanation
	For first test case, The rotation will be like this: 0 1 2 -> 2 1 0 -> 2 0 1 -> 2 0 1 So, Index of 1 will be 2.

### Question 2
	You have been given 2 special, extremely rugged MacBook Pros. You are in an office building that is 100 stories high. Using the fewest possible number of drops from windows in your office building, determine the highest floor you can drop a MacBook Pro from and have it survive: for example, they might be able to take the drop from the 30th floor, but not the 31st. You can break both MacBook Pros in your search. State the worst case number of drops needed and explain how you arrived at that answer.
