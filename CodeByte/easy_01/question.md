Question: >
Using the C++ language, have the function FirstReverse(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the string in reversed order.
Use the Parameter Testing feature in the box below to test your code with different arguments.

My Answer
in a word: exchange first and last elements, for example, given string 1234,
(1)  exchange 1 and 4 => 4231
(2)  exchange 2 and 3 => 4321
Done


Note:
Do not use pointer to point head and tail.
After you exchange the element value, the pointer exchanged as well,
then you have to change back the pointers.
This will make trouble.
