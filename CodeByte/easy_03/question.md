Have the function LongestWord(sen) take the sen parameter being passed and return the largest word in the string.
If there are two or more words that are the same length, return the first word from the string with that length.
Ignore punctuation and assume sen will not be empty.

Use the Parameter Testing feature in the box below to test your code with different arguments.

test case:
When the input was "123456789 98765432" => 123456789
When the input was "a beautiful sentence^&!" => beautiful
When the input was "letter after letter!!" => letter
When the input was "a confusing /:sentence:/[ this is not!!!!!!!~" => confusing
